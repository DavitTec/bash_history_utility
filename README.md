# Bash History Utility 

## Overview

The Bash History Utility (`bash_history.sh` or proposed `bash_history_tool.sh`) is intended to automate the management of Bash command history in terminal sessions. Its primary functions are to:

- **Dump**: Capture the current sessionâ€™s command history and save it as a Markdown file (`bash_history.md`).
- **Clear**: Clear both in-memory and on-disk (`~/.bash_history`) command history.
- **Archive**: Save the dumped history file with versioned timestamps.
- **Test**: Validate the dump and clear operations.

The utility is designed to be reusable across projects or as a standalone tool, supporting development workflows by preserving command history for documentation, debugging, or reuse. It was initially developed as part of the "HELPME" project (`script_bin_tools_dev`) but has been proposed as a separate project due to persistent issues.

## Current Status

- **Version**: 0.0.9  (proposed for standalone `bash_history_tool.sh`).
